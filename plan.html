Goals

To create a website that caters to a target audience of 15-30 years and will increase customers for the business by 50%

Success Evaluation

An increase of of at least 50% customers for the client. Slammers, the business, currently gets 100 people playing each week, therefore success would mean an increase to 150 people playing weekly.

Target Audience

The target audience for the website is an audience of 15-30 years of age. This will be achieved by implementing design choices that will cater to audiences of 15-30 years. For example, by limiting the number of webpages and links needed to navigate, having a clear and visible call to action, and organising the text in ways that are aesthetically pleasing.
